# Product Context: FileShotgunMcpServer

## Why This Project Exists
FileShotgunMcpServer was created to solve the challenge of efficiently accessing memory bank files in AI assistant workflows. Memory banks are crucial for maintaining context between AI sessions, but accessing multiple files individually can be inefficient and complex. This project provides a streamlined way to access all memory bank files at once through a simple MCP tool.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Fragmented Context**: Without a unified way to access memory bank files, AI assistants may have incomplete context, leading to less effective responses.
2. **Inefficient File Access**: Reading multiple files individually creates overhead and complexity in AI workflows.
3. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Different approaches to reading memory bank files can lead to inconsistent formatting and parsing challenges.
4. **Integration Complexity**: Integrating memory bank functionality into AI assistants can be complex without standardized tools.

## How It Should Work
1. The server runs as a background process, listening for MCP requests.
2. When a request to read a memory bank is received, the server:
   - Locates all markdown files in the specified directory
   - Reads the content of each file
   - Structures the content with clear delimiters
   - Returns the combined content as a single payload
3. The AI assistant can then parse this payload to understand the full context stored in the memory bank.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Simplicity**: Users should be able to set up and use the server with minimal configuration.
2. **Reliability**: The server should consistently provide accurate memory bank content.
3. **Performance**: Reading memory bank files should be fast and efficient.
4. **Integration**: The server should integrate seamlessly with existing AI assistant workflows.
5. **Maintainability**: The codebase should be clean, well-documented, and easy to maintain.

## Target Users
- AI assistant developers
- Users of AI assistants who want to maintain context between sessions
- Developers building tools that integrate with AI assistants
