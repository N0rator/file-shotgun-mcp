# Progress: FileShotgunMcpServer

## What Works
- ✅ Basic MCP server setup with standard I/O transport
- ✅ ReadMemoryBank tool implementation
- ✅ File reading with structured output format
- ✅ Markdown file filtering
- ✅ Error logging to stderr

## What's Left to Build
- ⏳ Comprehensive test suite
- ⏳ Enhanced error handling for edge cases
- ⏳ Performance optimizations for large memory banks
- ⏳ Additional memory bank tools (potential future enhancement)
- ⏳ Documentation improvements

## Current Status
The project is in a functional state with the core ReadMemoryBank tool implemented. The server can be built, published, and integrated with Cline AI assistant through the MCP configuration. The current implementation meets the basic requirements but could benefit from additional testing, error handling, and documentation.

## Known Issues
- No specific error handling for invalid directory paths
- No progress reporting for large memory banks
- No handling for very large files that could cause memory issues
- Limited to .md files only

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Concept
The project started with the goal of providing a simple way to access memory bank files for AI assistants. The initial concept was to create a tool that could read all files in a memory bank directory and return them as a single payload.

### Implementation Approach
1. **First Iteration**: Basic MCP server with ReadMemoryBank tool
   - Decision: Use ModelContextProtocol library for MCP server implementation
   - Outcome: Successfully implemented basic functionality

2. **Current State**: Functional tool with basic error handling
   - Decision: Use standard I/O for transport
   - Outcome: Simple integration with AI assistants

### Future Direction
The project will focus on:
1. Improving robustness through better error handling
2. Enhancing performance for large memory banks
3. Adding more comprehensive documentation
4. Potentially adding more memory bank-related tools
